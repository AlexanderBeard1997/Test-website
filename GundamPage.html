        <p class="Center">This is the full mechanics Barbatos Lupus it is the second variation of the main Gundam of the Iron Blooded Orphans series. It is the first Gundam that I built and I still go back to it as I yearn new techniques to make it look better, you can also see my first model kit in the background</p>
        <h1 class="Center">Dukemon</h1>
        <p class="Center">This is technically not a Gundam its actually a Digimon figure made by the same company. The cape on this model was really hard its made of a kind of flexible plastic I had to spend a long time to get it attached properly.</p>

        <h1 class="Center">Barbatos Lupus Rex</h1>
        <p class="Center">This is the Barbatos Lupus Rex the final iteration of the Gundam Barbatos it's a smaller model than the others and is not quite finished as there is still some detail work to finish, but I really enjoy the design</p>
