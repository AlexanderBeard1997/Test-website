    <h2 class="Center"><u>A short list of things that make my brain happy</u></h2>
    <p>
        I Like:

    <ul>

        <li>Games</li>
            <p>I play a lot of games in my free time my favorite genres are RPG's and Fighting games currently I'm learning Street Fighter 6 and waiting for the full release of Baldurs gate 3.</p>
        <li>Comics</li>
            <p>I am a big fan of comics I don't keep up with everything, but I try to read all the Batman and Iron man comics as they come out I have also recently been reading through some of the Venom comics</p>
        <li>DnD</li>
            <p>Dungeons and Dragons is really fun for me I don't get much chance to play now, but I used to run some campaigns for friends and played a couple of one shots I still jot down character ideas when I think of them</p>
        <li>Metal</li>
            <p>I like a lot of different music, but metal is my favorite I listen to a lot of Powerwolf but also like Sabaton, Disturbed, and Wind rose. I also like some older stuff like AC/DC.</p>
        <li>Gundam</li>
            <p>I discovered Gundam a little while ago and enjoy building them I am also watching through the series in my spare time. I fine building Gundam to be quite relaxing and love seeing the final product on my shelf.</p>
    </ul>
