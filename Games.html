            <img src="Images/marvel-midnight-suns.gif" width="500" height="400" class="Imgs">
            a card game with some RPG and strategy elements kinda has a XCOM like system where the heroes can be injured its a pretty fun game if you enjoy deck building and Marvel comics/movies.
            <li><u>Street Fighter 6</u></li>
            <img src="Images/ken-ken-masters.gif" width="500" height="400" class="Imgs">
            Learning a new fighting game is hard I never played older street fighters but bought the new on since its the biggest fighting game series out there and i play a lot of fighters the game is really forgiving to newcomers with a streamlined control system while maintaining a high skill ceiling for veteran players.
            <li><u>Baldurs Gate 3</u></li>
            <img src="Images/Baldurs gate.webp" width="500" height="400" class="Imgs">
            Baldurs Gate 3 is a massive CRPG based on DND 5E it has thousands of hours of cutscenes millions of lines of dialog and supports multiplayer its basicly a digital version of playing DnD and thats why i love it.
